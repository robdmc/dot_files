# Git flow instructions

### 4. User Control Requirements
- **No automatic git operations** - All git commands require explicit user approval
- **Present proposed commits clearly** - Show the full commit message before asking for approval
- **Allow user modifications** - User can request changes to commit messages
- **Respect user decisions** - If user rejects a commit, ask how they'd like to proceed

## Example Interaction Pattern
